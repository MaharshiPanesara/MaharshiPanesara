1. What is SDLC? 


->  The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and 
    build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer       expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process       into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.



2. Explain each phase of SDLC?


-> Requirement analysis   :- gathering and defining the needs and specifications of the software.


-> Planning                      :- estimating the resources, time, and cost of the project.


-> Software design           :- creating the architectural and detailed design of the software.


-> Software development :- writing and coding the software according to the design.


-> Testing                        :- verifying and validating the software for functionality, quality, and performance.


-> Deployment                 :- delivering and installing the software to the end-users.
